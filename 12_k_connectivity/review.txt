# Recap: Graph Connectivity, Mengerâ€™s Theorem, and Lab Exercises

## 1. Understanding Graph Connectivity
- **Graph Connectivity:** A graph is connected if all nodes are reachable from each other.
- **k-Connectivity:**
  - **k-vertex-connected:** The graph stays connected even after removing up to **(k-1) vertices**.
  - **k-edge-connected:** The graph stays connected even after removing up to **(k-1) edges**.
- **Bridges & Articulation Points:**
  - **Bridges**: Edges that, if removed, disconnect the graph.
  - **Articulation Points**: Nodes that, if removed, disconnect the graph.
- **BCCs (Biconnected Components):** Maximal subgraphs where **removing any single vertex doesn't disconnect it**.

## 2. Your Existing Code (`bccs.py`)
- **Finds:**
  - Bridges (1-edge-connectivity)
  - Articulation points (1-vertex-connectivity)
  - BCCs (helps determine 2-connectivity)
- **Does NOT yet check for k-connectivity (k > 2).**

### What We Did:
âœ” **Revised it into `bccs2.py`** to check for **k-vertex and k-edge connectivity.**  
âœ” **Added functions** to remove sets of **(k-1) vertices/edges** and check connectivity.  

ðŸ“¥ **Download `bccs2.py`**  

## 3. Mengerâ€™s Theorem
- **States that:**  
  - The **minimum number of nodes or edges** needed to disconnect two nodes **equals** the **maximum number of independent paths** between them.
- **Used for:**  
  - Finding **network weak points** (cybersecurity, traffic, social networks).
  - **Alternative paths** (road networks, robotics, AI planning).
  - **Analyzing graph resilience** (critical nodes, edges).

### What We Did:
âœ” **Created `menger.py`** to compute **min vertex/edge cuts and max-disjoint paths.**  
âœ” **Implemented a DFS-based version (`menger_revised.py`)** that avoids external libraries.

## 4. Real-World Applications & Lab Coding Exercises
- **Network Reliability** â†’ Find **weak points** in communication networks.
- **Road Networks** â†’ Find **alternative routes** if roads close.
- **Cybersecurity** â†’ Find **key servers** to protect from attacks.
- **Social Networks** â†’ Identify **influencers** in a network.
- **Traffic Congestion** â†’ Analyze **highways & congestion points**.
- **Robotics & AI** â†’ Find **optimal paths and obstacles**.

âœ” **Created `menger_problems.py`** to **apply Mengerâ€™s Theorem** to these problems.  
âœ” **Used a `MengerProblems` class** to structure different problem types.

## 5. How to Use in Your Lab Exercises
- **Find weak points in a network?** â†’ Use `menger_vertex_connectivity()`
- **Check alternative routes?** â†’ Use `menger_edge_connectivity()`
- **Simulate network attacks?** â†’ Use `min_vertex_cut()`
- **Optimize a road network?** â†’ Use `min_edge_cut()`
